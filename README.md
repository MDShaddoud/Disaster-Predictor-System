# Disaster-Predictor-System
The Disaster Predictor System is a machine learning model that is able to predict natural disasters using tweet data

Introduction:
The Disaster Predictor System is a machine learning model that is able to predict natural disasters using tweet data. The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can accurately predict natural disasters based on input data.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Keras
TensorFlow
Data Preprocessing:

The tweet data was collected and preprocessed using the pandas library
Data was cleaned and processed to remove any irrelevant information
The data was then split into training and testing sets
Model Building and Training:

The model was built using scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow
The model was trained on the training set and tested on the testing set
The model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and precision
Results:

The model achieved an accuracy of 90% in predicting natural disasters
The model was able to provide valuable insights and predictions for disaster management and response
Conclusion:
The Disaster Predictor System is a powerful tool that utilizes machine learning techniques to predict natural disasters using tweet data. With an accuracy of 90%, this system is able to provide valuable insights and predictions for disaster management and response. The project is implemented using Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow.
